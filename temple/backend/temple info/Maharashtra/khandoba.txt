The Khandoba temple of Jejuri is a Hindu temple dedicated to the god Khandoba, located on a hill in the town of Jejuri, Maharashtra, India. It is one of the most prominent Hindu pilgrimage centres of Maharashtra.

Jejuri's Khandoba is a Kuladaivata of many farming families and nomadic Dhangar tribe of the Maharashtra and Deccan region.

According to legends and folklore, Khandoba was a human Avatar of lord Shiva; he use to live and rule the region from Jejuri-gad (transl. Jejuri fort), where the mandir is now present. The mandir is also known as Jejuri-gad. Khandoba killed the demon brothers Mani and Malla, when they harassed people.

History
The worship of Khandoba began in the 12th to 13th century. It was built by Yadavas in 12th century. The Khandoba temple was rebuilt during the reign of the Peshwas.

In 1737–1739, Chimaji Appa, brother of Peshwa Baji Rao I, gifted Portuguese church bells from Vasai to the temple. He and his Maratha soldiers took the bells from Portuguese churches as conquest memorabilia, after defeating them in the Battle of Vasai (1737).

Legends

According to legend, two rakshasa brothers, Mani and Malla, pleased the god Brahma with their austerities. By Brahma's boon, they became very powerful and started destruction on Earth, harassing people. This led the God Shiva to arrive on earth in the avatar of Khandoba to destroy Mani and Malla. In a fierce battle, Khandoba killed one demon, and forgave the other when he promised to serve the common people.
