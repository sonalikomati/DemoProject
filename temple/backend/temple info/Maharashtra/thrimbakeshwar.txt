Temple legend:

Close up of the top of Trimbakeshwar Shiva Temple
Shri Trimbakeshwar is a religious center having one of the twelve Jyotirlingas. The extraordinary feature of the Jyotirlinga located here is its three faces embodying Brahma, Vishnu, and Shiva. Due to the excessive use of water, the linga has started to erode. It is said that this erosion symbolizes the eroding nature of human society. The Lingas are covered by a jeweled crown which is placed over the Gold Mask of Trideva (Brahma Vishnu Shiva). The crown is said to be from the age of Pandavas and consists of diamonds, emeralds, and many precious stones. The crown is displayed every Monday from 4-5 pm (Shiva).

All other Jyotirlingas have Shiva as the main deity. The entire black stone temple is known for its appealing architecture and sculpture and is at the foothills of a mountain called Brahmagiri. Three sources of the Godavari originate from the Brahmagiri mountain.

HISTROY:

The history of the Trimbakeshwar Temple is intertwined with both mythology and historical accounts. It is believed to have been originally built by the Maratha ruler, Nana Saheb Peshwa, in the 18th century. However, its roots go much deeper, connecting to ancient Hindu legends and texts. One
 of the most significant historical events associated with the temple is the ongoing tradition of the Kumbh Mela, a major Hindu pilgrimage held in Nashik every 12 years.

The temple is named after the sacred Trimbak Tirtha, which is believed to be the source of the Godavari River. This river, often referred to as the Ganges of the South, holds immense spiritual importance in Hinduism. According to ancient texts, it is said that Lord Rama, along with his wife Sita and brother Lakshmana, stayed at Trimbakeshwar during their 14-year exile.
